FORTESSA USAGE NOTES
-Turn on machine first, then software
-Most don't change laser strengths
-Run water before CS&T to check for cleanliness
	-(Fresh water)
	-Highest speed possible on machine
-Primes to flush the machine (multiple primes if machine is sitting for a while)
-Check waste
-Check water
-Dump waste if full (treat with bleach like LB)
-Refill DI water if empty

CST RUN (MOSTLY FOR LASER DELAY)
-Run on tube
-Run on lowest setting
-Run for laser delays
-1 mL PBS, 1-2 drops beads (CS&T)
-Look for 200-500 events/sec, if high, dilute
-Trigger on Fluorescence: If delays are more than 5-10 points off recorded values, check waste tank for back pressure
-Bright Bead % Robust CV: must be < 6%
-Contact Ben or Sylvia to run a new baseline

AUTOSAMPLER
-Sample Flow Rate: 1.5
-Sample volume: At least 20uL more than total sample
-Mixes: optional
-Wash volume: 400uL

DAILY CLEANING
-Check daily clean protocols (Requires ~1h)
-Run water after the run to check for cleanliness
