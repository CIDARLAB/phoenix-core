 * This class defines the grammar with which a cytometry experiment can be formed
 * This is perhaps part of the measurement grammar, but will be kept separate for the time being
 * It inputs a feature graph and outputs an ExperimentDesign
 * The experiment object still need more definition -> is it a graph also?
 * This will likely be where unit testing is determined also, but maybe there will be another class
